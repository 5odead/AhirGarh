## 3. ADD OBC & RESERVATIONS PAGE

Create: client/src/pages/ReservationsPage.tsx
Add route /reservations in App.tsx
Add "Reservations" in Navbar.tsx after Personalities

### EASY EDITING SYSTEM
At the top of ReservationsPage.tsx create a single content object:

const reservationContent = {
  title: "OBC & Reservations",
  titleHi: "ओबीसी और आरक्षण",
  subtitle: "A complete guide to reservation rights for the Yadav and Ahir community",
  lastUpdated: "February 2026",
  sections: [
    {
      id: "what-is-obc",
      heading: "What is OBC?",
      content: `Other Backward Classes (OBC) is a classification used by the Government of India to identify communities that are socially and educationally disadvantaged. The OBC category was established following the recommendations of the Mandal Commission in 1980 and implemented in 1990. The central government maintains a Central OBC List while each state maintains its own State OBC List. Being on the central list gives reservations in central government jobs and central universities while state list gives reservations in state government jobs and state institutions.`
    },
    {
      id: "yadav-status",
      heading: "Are Yadavs and Ahirs OBC?",
      content: `Yes. The Yadav community, also known as Ahir, is listed as OBC in the Central OBC List maintained by the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC). This means Yadavs are eligible for 27% OBC reservation in central government jobs, central universities, IITs, IIMs, NITs and all central institutions across India. Additionally Yadavs are listed in the state OBC lists of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and most other states — giving them state-level reservation benefits as well.`
    },
    {
      id: "percentages",
      heading: "Reservation Percentages",
      content: `In central government jobs and central educational institutions, OBC reservation is 27% of total seats and posts. This applies to all central government departments, PSUs, IITs, IIMs, NITs, AIIMS, central universities and all institutions funded by the central government.\n\nState-wise OBC reservation percentages:\n\nUttar Pradesh — 27%\nBihar — varies by sub-category (EBC + BC combined)\nHaryana — 27%\nRajasthan — 21%\nMadhya Pradesh — 14%\nMaharashtra — 19%\nDelhi — 27% (follows central rules)`
    },
    {
      id: "creamy-layer",
      heading: "What is Creamy Layer?",
      content: `Creamy Layer refers to the relatively advanced and well-off members within OBC communities who are excluded from OBC reservation benefits. If your family income exceeds the prescribed limit you fall under Creamy Layer and cannot avail OBC reservation.\n\nThe current Creamy Layer income limit is Rs 8 lakh per annum (verify latest figure from official sources before applying). This limit considers income from salary and agriculture — not income from property.\n\nChildren of IAS, IPS and Group A officers are automatically considered Creamy Layer regardless of income.`
    },
    {
      id: "certificate",
      heading: "How to Get Your OBC Certificate",
      content: `Documents Required:\n— Aadhaar Card\n— Ration Card or domicile proof\n— Income Certificate of parents\n— Caste proof such as father or grandfather documents\n— Passport size photos\n— School leaving certificate\n\nWhere to Apply: Visit your local Tehsil office or SDM (Sub Divisional Magistrate) office. In most states you can also apply online through your state's e-district portal.\n\nCentral vs State Certificate: For central government jobs you need a Central OBC Certificate specifically. A state OBC certificate alone is not sufficient for central reservations. Request a certificate valid for central government purposes when applying.`
    },
    {
      id: "mandal",
      heading: "The Mandal Commission",
      content: `The Mandal Commission, officially the Second Backward Classes Commission, was established in 1979 under the chairmanship of B.P. Mandal. It submitted its report in 1980 recommending 27% reservation for OBC communities in central government jobs and educational institutions.\n\nThe recommendations were implemented in 1990 by Prime Minister V.P. Singh, triggering massive protests across India but fundamentally transforming the social and political landscape.\n\nFor the Yadav community the Mandal Commission was a watershed moment — it gave constitutional backing to social equality and led directly to the rise of Yadav political power in north India through leaders like Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad Yadav.`
    },
    {
      id: "important-note",
      heading: "Important Note",
      content: `Reservation policies change over time. The information on this page is for general guidance only. Always verify current rules from official government sources — ncbc.nic.in for central OBC list and your state government's official website for state-specific rules. For certificate applications always consult your local Tehsil office.`
